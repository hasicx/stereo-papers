# Stereo and Deep Learning

A collection of relevant papers within the intersection of stereo vision and
deep learning.

## Overviews

The following four papers are recent reviews of the field.
There is some overlap as they cover the same research area.
The surveys do differ with regard to depth and are not equally technical.
As a whole, they offer a relevant and in-depth overview of the field
(deep) learning-based stereo vision.
